# Unexpected Navigation Behavior in React Router Dom with Nested Routes

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in React Router Dom v6 where navigation between nested routes using Links behaves unexpectedly.  Sometimes links fail to transition to the correct route, resulting in broken navigation. The issue appears intermittently and is difficult to reproduce consistently, making debugging challenging.  The `App.js` file contains the buggy code; `AppSolution.js` provides a potential solution.

## Bug Description
The navigation between routes (Home and About) using the `<Link>` component shows inconsistent behavior.  The links may unexpectedly fail to navigate, leaving the user on the current page instead of the intended one.  This error is not consistently reproducible, making it harder to track down.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Observe the navigation between the Home and About pages.  The issue is not consistently reproducible but will occur with sufficient usage.

## Potential Solution
The solution may involve a more careful structuring of routes and the handling of nested links, as provided in `AppSolution.js`.
